Simple app that updates Windows hosts file with unwanted websites.

Just list unwanted websites in the a file named "block-list" (each in a separate line) in the same directory as produced exe file. I recommend adding this program to Windows Scheduler so that it starts with the system. It's worth mentioning that it requires administrative rights to access hosts file. With it running you might be less tempted to open websites that are no more than simple time wasters ;)
